# This is a sample workflow to test or replace with your source code.
#
# This workflow passes the current day of the week to the Wikipedia API and
# returns a list of related Wikipedia articles.
# The current day of the week (in GMT) is retrieved from a Cloud Function
# unless you input your own search term (for example, {"searchTerm": "Monday"}).
